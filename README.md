### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Avag. I'm currently learning web development and I'm excited to share my experiences and knowledge during my journey to becoming a software engineer. I really enjoy building projects, challenging myself and pushing harder and harder every time, cause that's the only way to grow.
Currently I'm focused on front-end development and I'm learning [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
